# STM32EJ

## Objective

The aim of designing this board was to:
  - develop a better understanding of circuit desing relating to ST microcontrollers
  - develop a working knowledge of UART, SPI, I2C, USB communication protocols as relates to STM32s
  - Have an STM32 board on hand for future projects
